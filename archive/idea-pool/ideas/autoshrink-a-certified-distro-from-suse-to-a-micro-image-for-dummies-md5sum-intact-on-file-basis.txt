===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */

o Main Goal:

  Install a machine with a certified set of packages and automatically generate
  from that a micro image and a couple of (definable) addon overlays that
  you then can easily stack together, image and deploy on virtual instances,
  or use for a rescue system sitting on a PXE server, USB stick or local
  harddisk partition or image. 

o Sub Goals:

  o Stay as close to the certified original as possible (like starting from
    a SLES 10 SP1 minimal install, which is still too big for my target of a
    small but stackable micro+addon toolkit)
  o Keep at least the MD5SUM on a file level intact to the certified original
  o Easy to use this auto-shrinker => a script or fully automate it
  o Easy to develop it => My programming skills are moderate and becoming a manager
    did not improve them either ;-) But if you give me a pool of RPMs and a UNIX
    command line I can do interesting stuff like LISA (Caldera's text based installer) ;-)
  o Contribute something that might be usefull for our customers and field engineers,
    work with others in a team during hackweek who have similar/complementary ideas/skills
    and then merge projects and create a UNIX-pipe-onliner-superthing by interfacing with
    their projects (pre- or afterburners). If somebody builds a nice GUI frontend and
    yet other write some documentation around it and its architecture, this would be
    my dream of how hackfest should work ;-)
  o KISS (those who not know what this means ask others and make friends by getting
    closer to the community, if all that fails ask me ;-)


===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Ralf Flaxa originated this idea. Ralf Flaxa is working on this idea. Cornelius Schumacher, Marcus Schaefer, Nat Friedman and James Willcox seem to be interested or work on similar ideas or have created
similar/related projects. Ralf will contact them to see how we might want to join forces/projects.

===== Related Materials =====
/* Links, mockups, screen captures, files. */

The instsys system image on SUSE SLE or openSUSE CDs (CD1:/boot/<ARCH>/root)

The rescue system image on SUSE SLE or openSUSE CDs (CD1:/boot/<ARCH>/rescue)

Some script/tool which comes with Xen (forgot name, will look it up)
(I actually have a patched (unfinished) version where I tried to make it work
with the kernel and rescue image from any SUSE product CD1/DVD1, will try to
find it on my backup).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
