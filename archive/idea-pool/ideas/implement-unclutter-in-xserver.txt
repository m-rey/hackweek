====== Implement unclutter in xserver ======

{{tag>Idea Desktop X11 HelpWanted}}

===== Description =====

The nice little program unclutter has limitations. With some applications (e.g. xchat) the mouse cursor can start to flicker and the CPU usage raises to 100%. Other limitations are listed in the man-page.

The xserver is the right place for the functionality of unclutter. xset could be used to set parameters.

Arvin Schnell originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
