====== Broadcom Wireless Drivers ======

{{tag>Idea driver hardware wifi}}

===== Description =====
I've been a distro whore looking for a distro that supports a lot of current hardware right out of the gate. Yes, I know... insert N00b comment here. The biggest problem I've run into is the lack of support from hardware vendors. Everytime I build out a new HP/Acer/Etc I run into problems with the Broadcom wireless adapter. It would be great if someone would write a driver for this darn thing. I know that I can do ndiswrapper, but this always seems like a pain in the arse.

===== People =====
Michael A. Keller originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
