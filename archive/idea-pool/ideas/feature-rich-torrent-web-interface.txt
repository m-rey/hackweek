===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
A web torrent client that does most work on the client side. It's intended for routers and NAS-devices that can run a little torrent client but should not have to work to much in order to display a web interface. 

Rendering the information is done on the client side. The client only pulls plain ASCII data with Ajax calls from the server. The goal is to minimize the work on the server side while still getting a decent client interface
