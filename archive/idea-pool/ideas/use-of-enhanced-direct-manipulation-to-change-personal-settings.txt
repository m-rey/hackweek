===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
  * How can we enhance configuration tasks by
    * enhanced direct manipulation
    * use of 3D-elements
    * perhaps adoption of some game interaction techniques?

  * The idea to use 3D-environments and direct manipulation to enhance the interaction possibilities with the ui is not new (Apple, IBM, Microsoft made their experience with it). The idea behind is, that the presentation and interaction in a kind of "real live environment" will reduce the learning curve drastically and the side-effect will be some "universal usability" (e.g. older users are not forced to learn new interaction techniques).
  * The range of the interaction can reach from "full simulation" (e.G. Erlanger 3D-BÃ¼ro [screenshots will be added], Second Life) to reduced complexity (power plant control by use of Star Craft dialog elements http://www.benjamins.nl/cgi-bin/t_articles.cgi?bookid=IDJ%2010%3A1&artid=938017538) to abstract direct manipulation (Apple Stacks http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/features/desktop.html).
  * The challenge at the other side is, that simulation environments can be unproductive (except in the special context of pc games). 

  * The question is: can we use some of the concepts to provide a cool configuration experience ... perhaps in addition to the current existing one? Look at the "Gnome Desktop Font Preferences" or the "Menu and Toolbar Preferences". Is this a cool experience to change the settings?


===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Siegfried Olschner originated this idea.  He is currently working on creating illustrations for this idea.

===== Some Results =====

== First concept drafts ==
  * The basic idea was to provide a kind of desktop fake. 
  * All elements with changeable properties will be marked via mouse over effects. 
  * A click will open the options box. 
  * Perhaps the user can activate a kind of tooltip help.

== Thinking about some details ==

  * How to visualize the screensaver in this concept? Via illustration in the background?
  * Can we find a kind of consistent selection mode where the user can pick one option -- e.g. in the screensaver selection.
    * Perhaps via vertical scroll of elements while the other dialog elements are displayed beside
  * How to cross screensaver selection with the adjustment of hot corners?
  * etc., etc.

== How to open ==

  * A nice try
    * Not acceptable in the view of accessability
    * Only available during use of XGL?

== Some mockups ==

  * Some trials to find a good way to visualize interactive sections on the "faked desktop"
  * I think a visual designer can produce better solutions

== Change of the concept ==

  * The concept above shows a kind of "whow-effect" but owns may challenges in the details


  * NEW: User can activate the "personal preferences setup" via keyboard or menu selection by mouse
  * Like the Apple Dashboard the personal preferences items will fly in (animation!), the background is darkened
  * Mouse over one element will enlight it, the others are darkened
  * Click will expand the selection to a window. It's size is big enough to provide enough space for very comfortable item selection in direct way
    * E.g. font selection: The fonts are displayed with their shape, the size is adjusted to the current selection
    * Icon set selection: The icon theme is represented via some examples

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
