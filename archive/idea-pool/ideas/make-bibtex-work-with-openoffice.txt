===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */

BibTex is the bibliography database most used by computer science scholars, coming from the TeX/LaTeX world. I, like lots of academics, have a very large bibtex database of citations, and I don't want to give it up.

OpenOffice is much more attractive than TeX/LaTeX for writing many technical papers; GUI/WYSIWYG is just more pleasant much of the time. However, OO does **not** work with bibtex :-(

Idea: provide either an OO module of some kind, or an outboard filter script, to compute a document bibliography using a bibtex database.

Background: Between TeX and OpenOffice, I spent a bunch of time using FrameMaker to write papers. Frame was (mostly) only for Windows, but I used VMware to host it. I wanted bibtex, and it turns out that there **is** an outboard filter for [[http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/framemaker/fbib.html|BibTeX for FrameMaker]] An easy way to implement this idea would be to adapt fbib so that it can parse OpenDoc instead of Frame's MIL format.

There is also an "alpha" bibtex for OO project, but work stopped in 2003 [[http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/openoffice/misc/bibtex/filter.html|OpenOffice BibTeX Filter]] I guess the student graduated :-(

Reviewing the various projects, it seems this idea has been started several times, and never finished.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Crispin Cowan originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
