===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
With SLED10 we added this nicely integrated support for joining Microsoft Active Directory Enviroments. Which led us to a state where the support for Linux Clients in AD Enviroments looks more polished and feature complete than what we provide in Linux-only environments.

The goal of this idea is to improve this situation by creating a similar experience in Linux-only environments, based on open-source software. This means e.g. improving the interaction between the various Services that are involved in such a scenario (LDAP, Kerberos, DNS, NTP, ...) as well as implementing tools to maintain such an environment (e.g. a tool to securely join/unjoin a client to the enviroment).

===== Status Update ====
As I am currently not able to add comments to this page I put my status update here. 

Our main goals have been reached. We have developed a tool (written in C) that we can use to join a client into our server environment. The tool does locate all the required services (LDAP, Kerberos, NTP) via DNS SRV and TXT lookups.
And does the following steps:

    *  Dynamically update the running ntpd via ntpdc to sync with the newly detected server. Thanks to Andreas and Lars for working on this. As I understand they already working on integrating this new mechanism into our base distribution, as it proved to be useful in other environments as well (e.g. when NTP servers are distributed via DHCP or in the Active Directory environment).

    * Contact the LDAP server to find out the Parent Object under which the principal for the machine account should be created (currently we use e.g. "ou=Computers,....").

    * Create the Kerberos Principal for the machine account and export the key to a local keytab

    * Get a TGT  for the machine account and store it into a CCACHE.

    * Adjust nss_ldap's configuration so that it uses SASL-GSSAPI authentication to securely contact the LDAP server.

Most of the functionality is implemented in a shared library. The tool and the shared library were mostly developed my Marius, Michael and me. Andreas help us a lot to get started with CMake.

Additionally, Marius wrote a tool that is able to renew or reinit the TGT when required. (This tool could e.g. be started through cron). Currently he is working to put this tool into our shared library so that it can be used be others as well.

We are still working on a script that is able to automatically configure a server so that it fits the requirements the requirement of our clients. (Bringing up and initializing LDAP, Kerberos and NTP. Creating the required TXT and SRV records in DNS, and so on). This (somewhat unthankful) task is being done by our brave guys, Mili and Peter :).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
