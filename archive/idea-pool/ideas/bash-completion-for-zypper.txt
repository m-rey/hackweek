====== BASH completion for zypper ======

{{tag>Idea TryMe}}

===== Description =====
I miss bash completion script for zypper, so i make a decision to create one. My BASH completion script have basic features, like suggestion of command (help, install, update,...) in future, when zypper will be faster then now i want to implement suggestion of package name for //zypper install [package]//. It is not possible to implement it now, because zypper search is much slow...
