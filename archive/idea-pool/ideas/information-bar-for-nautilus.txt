====== Information bar for nautilus ======

{{tag>Idea,nautilus,desktop,gnome}}

===== Description =====
I was inspired by the new file-manager of KDE which is called Dolphin, you know.
An information bar in nautilus which gives the possibility to get the main information about
the document, the possibility to rate and to add a comment to the file/directory.

And with beagle it should be possible then to search for high rated files and through
the descriptions and so on.


===== People =====
Andy Pischka originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
