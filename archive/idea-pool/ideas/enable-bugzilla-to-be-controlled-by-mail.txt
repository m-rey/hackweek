====== Enable Bugzilla to be controlled by mail ======
{{tag>Community Management openSUSE SLES Idea mail devtool bugs internal}}

===== Description =====
I know, Bugzilla can *send* mails to get notified about changes for bugs. But
you have still to open a browser, log in (wait 20 seconds) and type your
changes here.

I like the way the Debian bug system handles the bugs. Just mail to
bugnumber@bugs.debian.org to add a comment into the bug system. There are some
control commands like "reassign" or "reopen".

See http://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control.

Of course, this should be *additional* to the web interface. For more exotic
tasks the web interface is better, but for the general task which is to add a
comment and maybe set the bug to NEEDINFO, the email is much faster (at least
for me ;-)).


===== People =====
Bernhard Walle originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
