====== Linux-HA/heartbeat: shared storage STONITH (SBD) ======

{{tag>Idea Server UnixFeature SLES Done InBuildService}}

===== Description =====
The idea is to create a STONITH mechanism which works through the shared storage, akin to the Novell Cluster Services's Split-Brain-Detector's "poison pill."

This would allow Linux-HA (the underlaying technology to SLES's High-Availability Storage Infrastructure) to be applicable in all scenarios where shared storage exists, and not always require an external power switch to fence.

Scenarios of this kind include virtualized environments as well as certain split-site configurations as well.

As this item protects the data integrity of the cluster, it must be very reliable.

===== People =====
Lars Marowsky-Br√©e originated this idea and will work on this during HackWeek 2008.
