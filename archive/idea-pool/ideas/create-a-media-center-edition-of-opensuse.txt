====== Create a "Media Center" edition of openSUSE ======

{{tag>InProgress Desktop SLED openSUSE multimedia HW-Designer HW-Hacker HW-Tester JudgeBest JudgeMe}}

===== Description =====

Create a one-CD/DVD solution to turn a computer into a Media Center, a Media Center would:

  * Watch TV
  * Record of TV / Playback of recorded TV
  * Configure TV setup by different cable/satellite/tv providers
  * Configure IR setup by different remotes/recivers
  * DVD / File player
  * Music player
  * Image Viewer
  * Games (???)
  * Network Export of Media Files (NFS/SMB/HTTP)

Software to use

  * [[http://freevo.sf.net/|Freevo]] as general visual frontend
  * xine or mplayer as backend (for TV it might be wiser to use vdr or dvbstream)
  * YaST modules to configure IR/TV/Export
  * Different Emulators (dgen, mame) and games (ManiaDrive, supertuxcart etc.)
  * [[http://www.musicpd.org/|Music Player Daemon]] and clients as music player backend
  * [[http://www.jinzora.org/|Jinzora]] as HTTP media frontend

=====TODO=====
  
  Stuff we can do:

  * channels.conf to TV_CHANNELS(local_conf.py) conversion
  * jinzora setup
  * mpd setup
  * games setup
  * NFS/SMB export
  * ivman setup

  Stuff we cant do:

  * Ask lslezak to finish yast tv module channel configuration for dvb*
  * Ask lslezak to finish yast tv module configuration for lirc 
    * Idea: cat all lircd configs into one, ask user to press button on the remote parse irw output for remote name and trim config down to that remote.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.
