===== Description =====

Regular digital cameras today can all record movies. While downloading
of those movies works nicely, the playing of them mostly does not work.

The movies are usually in MOV and AVI containerformats, with usually PCM
audio and Motion JPEG video.

Xine, one of the two major engines and used by the KDE desktop supports playing motion jpeg
videostreams only using "ffmpeg", which we cannot ship on openSUSE.

However, Motion JPEG is not patent encumbered as other codecs in the ffmpeg pack.

The project gets movies playing with the openSUSE out-of-the-box
OSS libraries and the code will be integrated into xine.

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1744426&group_id=9655&atid=359655 is my patch submission to Xine SF.

(Originally I also wanted to tackle gstreamer, but it already has Motion JPEG support seperately.
 It can play AVIs in 10.2 out of the box, but no MOV files. The latter is already fixed for 10.3).

My talk to present it: http://w3.suse.de/~meissner/marcus_mjpeg_talk.avi (360MB, Novell internal)

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
