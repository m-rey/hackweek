====== Rewrite Dark Oberon to use open-source sound library ======

{{tag>Idea Community Sound games openSUSE}}

===== Description =====

Dark Oberon is an open source real-time strategy game similar to Warcraft II released under GPL. However, it uses FMOD sound library which is closed source and has no 64-bit version. (FMOD developers are focusing on newer FMODex API and have no intention to release 64-bit FMOD.)

There are 2 options:

  * rewrite game to use newer FMODex API (allows 64-bit build, still closed source though)
  * use open source sound library like SDL_mixer, OpenAL or similar

First option is IMHO easier, but second one is certainly greater! ;-)

===== People =====

Pavol Rusnak originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
