===== Description =====
**Motivation**: you want to make a party at home, with video-clips playing at a big screen in the background (in the living room for example).

**Problems**:
  * You have to do a pre-download of your video-clips.
  * Everybody will want to be a DJ so there will be a lot of people forming a queue in your computer
  * People will get angry if somebody stops/skips his song
  * Everybody will shout at you if you don't have <put your favourite song here>, so
  * Everybody will want to use YouTube instead of your video playing list, and
  * YouTube has a very low sound/video quality for the general speed you may get in order not to pre-buffer the content.
  * Sound is more important than video in a party (come on, it's a party, not a cinema), so:

__Idea A__: why not using the audio from your music playlists and the video from youtube?

**However**:
  * This still doesn't solve the problem of letting the people choose the music in an organized way.
  * You may have buffering problems and, as a consequence, not constant playback, if you rely on your poor internet connection.

**Then**:

__Idea B__ (which would solve last two problems in one shot): why not having a mode on Banshee that let's you choose what is *going* to play (as opposed to what is playing right now or what was put in the queue firstly by others), which intelligently tries to pre-download videos in the background (maybe doing multiple downloads simultaneously?), and stops the music (or replaces it with other playlist) if the buffering is not successfull? (It wouldn't forward to the next song, as opposed to stoping a song playback in the middle of the song.)

**In the end**:
  * People won't be able to choose a song that is not in your library so.

__Future ideas__:
  * Integrate this extension with another extension that communicates to some P2P programs such as Monsoon or Nicotine+, in order to download music.

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
