====== End-to-end "OEM Linux" creator ======

{{tag>Idea DevTool openSUSE SLED SLES}}

===== Description =====

Extend the existing Product Creator to include branding, an installation workflow editor etc. and integrate it with the openSUSE Build Service.

The aim should be to have a tool that allows creating a fully customized and branded special-purpose Linux based on SUSE Linux Enterprise or openSUSE with one tool chain from adding and compiling new packages in the Build Service to creating images with KIWI.

This may need some groundwork, e.g. a clearer separation of the branding files that currently are spread over many packages.

===== People =====

Joachim Werner originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
