====== Improve USB dump analysis support in Wireshark ======

{{tag>Idea DevTool HelpWanted}}

===== Description =====

**Update:**

It appears that wireshark with CVS libpcap can already capture and highlight base USB traffic, as well as USB Mass Storage protocol. (try packages from [[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dgollub/|dgollub's home]])

Oops, I'm too late!

Therefore, this project's aim is now to do the following:
  * implement PTP/MTP packet dissector
  * possibility of importing USB dumps from windows tools (usbsnoop, USB Monitor, XML export format)
  * get all this to STABLE and, if possible, upstream


===== Original description =====

This should be a tool, similar in purpose to Wireshark, but for USB traffic. It should be able to read current traffic from debugfs, and decode USB dumps from tools like [[sourceforge.net/projects/usbsnoop/|usbsnoop]].

Most importantly, it should be able to decode various USB protocols - I am aiming for PTP/MTP, but the tool should be extensible and handle protocols as plugins.

It would also be nice if the tool allowed interactive USB packet forging, but I'm not sure if that is feasible.

In the short term, I would like to get to a state where the tool is able to read live traffic and/or USB dump and output translated MTP packets in human readable format.

As a long term goal, this tool should be an open-source alternative to [[http://www.hhdsoftware.com/Products/home/usb-monitor.html|USB Monitor]].

jan matejek originated this idea and will be working on it during HackWeek 3.

I have next to no experience with USB development so I'd appreciate any help in that area, even pointers to good documentation.
