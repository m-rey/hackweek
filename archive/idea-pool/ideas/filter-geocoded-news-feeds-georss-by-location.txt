===== Description =====

[[http://www.openstreetmap.org/|OpenStreetMap]] provides GeoRSS feeds of the users' [[http://www.openstreetmap.org/diary|diaries]] and [[http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces|traces]]. I want to filter them by location so that I only see ones near my home. [[http://mvidner.blogspot.com/2008/08/openstreetmap-diaries-via-georss-box.html|Geofilter]] is the result. It is a very simple web service to which you pass a GeoRSS feed and a bounding box and it gives you the filtered feed.

Interested? Write to me.

Have I reinvented the wheel? AFAIK there is no such free service. ([[http://pipes.yahoo.com/|Yahoo Pipes]] can do many things but not this.)
