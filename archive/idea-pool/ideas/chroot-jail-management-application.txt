===== Description =====
On Linux, chroot jails can be used as a practical tool for securing applications and creating environments that are sealed off from the rest of the system without the overhead of a complete virtualized system.

Currently, there are several tools & applications which ease the creation of such jails but none of them provides a proper way for updating and checking the consistency of existing jails.

The idea is to create a tool that allows the automatic creation of minimal jails, containing only the necessary files for each application which are copied over from the host system. Various component types can be defined and then used in multiple chroot configurations which can be updated automatically as soon as the host system receives an update.

Possible use cases:
  * Web applications
  * Sealed-off SSH and SFTP access
  * Untrusted closed source binaries

== OpenSSH / SFTP ==
A [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/chrootssh/|well-tested]] patch for OpenSSH exists which allows the chrooting of individual users directly after they log in. This is very useful if you want to setup secure file transfer and restrict the user to a certain directory instead of allowing him to browse through the whole system directory tree.
You can use this method together with sftp-server or rsync -e ssh.

== Web applications ==
Some web applications are error prune and subject to frequent security
updates. In an uncontrolled environment, for example on a server with many users which are allowed to run dynamic web sites, it's essential that old,
outdated web apps don't compromise the security of the rest of the system.
A possible solution would be to create individual jails for each website with
interpreters like PHP, Perl or Python. A web server can communicate with the interpreters using TCP/IP or UNIX domain sockets via the
[[http://www.fastcgi.com/|FastCGI protocol]].

== Closed source binaries ==
Untrusted binaries are another possible subject for jailing. For example
one could want to run a game server like Unreal Tournament which has been and
is subject to remote security issues.

== Further security ==
There are several pseudo-shells that chroot and afterwards drop the privileges to a certain user. For this project, http://www.jmcresearch.com/projects/jail/ would be practical.

Additional security for chroot jails is provided by the
[[http://www.grsecurity.net/|grsecurity kernel patchset]] which closes some
holes that could be used to break out of jails.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Wolfgang Frisch originated this idea. There's already some written Python code, so it's sort of work-in-progress though I'd like to do a rewrite and of course would be happy about any help from anyone who's interested in this topic :)

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
