===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */

I would like to have/work on a set of tools (esp. development tools) for the most common existing robot projects. For the beginning, focusing on the Lego Mindstorms set (old RCX and new NXT) would be more than enough.

  * Packaging of "Not Quite C" aka NQC for RCX
  * NXC for the the new hardware (NXT)
  * The Java firmware and the Java programming tools: LEJOS
  * packaging of BrickOS
  * easy set up of environement for ARM development
  * Mid term having an IDE/set like Microsofts Robotic Studio




===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Mihnea Istinie originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!)...
And I don't think that a lot of people are interested in robotics. However, I'll have the HW in the office during the week, so that everybody can play around.

I've built a robot, which will be programmed to kidnap the best hackers and packagers for this idea.
As you maybe already know, resistance is futile.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
