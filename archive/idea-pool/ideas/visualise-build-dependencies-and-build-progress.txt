====== Visualise build dependencies and build progress ======


{{tag>Idea BuildService devtool}}

===== Description =====
It would be interesting to visualize (build) dependencies of packages in
BuildService, using graphviz for instance. And it would be cool if the
build monitor would be available as an online refreshing dependency
tree, so you could watch the nodes turning green and have an overview on
what's going to build next. Perhaps the packages could be placed in the
graph depending on their status, eg. one big pool for to-be-build, one
pool for each build host, a dumping place of failed packages, a place
for built packages...

With a larger project (or when watching build of all BS projects?), it
would make for a good xscreensaver hack ;-)

===== People =====
Michal Marek originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
