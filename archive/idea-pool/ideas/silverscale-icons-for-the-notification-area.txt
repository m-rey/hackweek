===== Description =====
Current notification areas already get pretty crowded. With some applets nearby the situation gets worse. The nice colorfullness of our beautiful icons create a situation where it gets harder and harder to grasp important notifications.

That's why we should create silverscale replacements for notification area icons and some applet icons.

  * Silverscale, because we are using the 6 Tango silver colors, they should be enough.
  * Silverscale, because could look very classy and professional.
  * Exception to the rule: Warnings etc **should** still use a bit of red or orange
  * Make it and addon , so people can use regular colorful Tango if they want to and to fall back to colorful icons if no silverscale icons exist.


Goals:
  * Make the panel lock more professional when many icons are present
  * Make warning icons more visible because those are the only icons using colors other than silver.
  * Fit into Tango Icon Theme

List of applets that could need Silverscale icons:

  * network-manager
  * battery applet
  * weather applet (this will be hard)
  * sound volume applet
  * im applets
  * deskbar applet
  * brightness applet
  * resolution switcher

First Iterations for gpm available for review:

After a little chat with Garrett, we decided to go for an even simpler design. These pics show some icons of the design-rc and form a base for the final theme. Will try to package those asap.

The first picture shows from left to right: gnome-power-manager (on ac power), nm-applet (wired connection), audio-volume (medium), clock (no icon), deskbar-applet.

{{ideas:silverscale-rc-pic1.png|almost final design}}

Here are shown: g-p-m (on battery power, 99%), nm-applet (connecting to network, no a throbber doesn't always have to be a circle-ish thing), rest the same;

Here are shown: g-p-m (on battery power), nm-applet (wireless network @ 42%);

Look also at some of jimmac mockups for desktop effects. In those he sometimes uses greyed icons on the panel IIRC.

/* How to Use Tags

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
