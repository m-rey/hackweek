====== Migration Assistant ======

{{tag>Community InProgress Installation Desktop openSUSE}}

===== Description =====

Ubuntu came with nice feature called Migration Assistant. It helps
user to migrate documents and settings from another OS present on
system. Currently it supports Windows (XP and Vista) and Linux. It
would be nice feature to have also in SUSE.

I ported Ubuntu assistant to SUSE in December, but the original code is full of bugs
and not very well designed. I would like to rewrite it from scratch in C++,
using interfaces which will allow to write import/export plugins.
Also support for migrating system wide settings could be nice
(for example, various config files from /etc or registry, copying binary wifi driver
from Windows into ndiswrapper). I'm open to any of your ideas!  :) 

===== People =====

Pavol Rusnak originated this idea and will be working on it during HackWeek.
