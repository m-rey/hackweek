{{tag>Idea Kernel HelpWanted}}

===== Description =====
A kernel patch or module would upon pressing alt-sysrq-x start a shell script somewhere from /etc or /bin (or at worst a binary if shell would be technically difficult).
This could be used to recover frozen X without need for complete restart, perhaps also people who use network sysrq daemons could fine some use. So one could flexibly extend the range of possibilities in case of machine freeze.

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.
