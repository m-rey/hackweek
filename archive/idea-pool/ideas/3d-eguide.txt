===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
When you have a company directory with more then 1000 users using it, it is almost meaningless when you looking at the name, email and phone number. You don't know what that person do and working on. 
What we need is "secondlife" like 3D emulation of our work space. Create your own image and symbol online and let your script answer all the possible for you. You then can create a self-explain or resume like description on your symbol. So when someone is looking for you in the direction, eGuide will fly you from ourside of the earth then dive into the world map, country, city, building, floor, section, sit then your symbol. When others click on your symbol, self-description will be provided, voice greeting, and other job description like text will be avalible. Of course a person FAQ will be like for CEO type char, message board and blog linker will also be addon etc

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
