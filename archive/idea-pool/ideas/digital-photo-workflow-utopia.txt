===== Description =====
==Problem: Dealing with my digital photos takes TOO LONG!==

==Solution:==
  - Take some pictures
  - Plug my camera in to my computer (yes, I'd still get a popup dialog asking me whether I want to import photos)
  - Photos are transferred from my camera to my computer
  - Review photos in full screen
    * During the review the app should let me
      * Delete obvious bad ones (blurry, etc.)
      * Rate the photos
      * Tag the photo (keywords, who's in the photo, etc.)
      * Rotate, adjust the exposure/white balance, fix red-eye, etc.
      * Place them in any of my pre-defined albums (or let me create a new album on the fly)
  - I'm DONE!
    * THIS step is where all the magic happens!
    * Some program (process) should be watching my every move in my photo tool and ...
    * When it detects that I've finished importing my photos (or really any time I modify the tags or organize my photos differently) it takes care of the most important thing...uploading/updating them to Flickr!
      * Converts RAW files to appropriately-sized JPEG files for upload (and then delete the JPEG files off my computer after the upload is finished)
      * Sets the permission on the photo automatically (public/private/family/friends)
        * This could be done based on the tags i add on the photo (with a smart default if the tag isn't there)
      * Adds the photo to a set (match it up with the album I already set up in my photo tool)
        * Match it up with the album I placed the photo in or a special tag/keyword (e.g., "Set:My Best Shots")
    * Extra Credit: New photos are automatically archived onto an external hard drive/server/etc.

Get the idea?  Get rid of manually exporting/uploading to Flickr!

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
