====== Firmware downloader for wi-fi cards ======

{{tag>Idea Kernel wireless}}

===== Description =====

Many modern wi-fi cards need a firmware. Unfortunately, most of firmware images are under license that doesn't allow redistribution, so we cannot make a RPM with them.

To solve that, some Linux drivers have a tool for extracting firmware from a Windows driver or downloading it from a predefined set of locations. That's not ideal as you need a different tool for different hardware and automated tools (like YaST) can not reliably use it.

It would be nice to have a tool, that either scans for available wi-fi cards or is given a particular PCI or USB ID and for each card:
  * Report a name of driver required for this card,

  * report that the card doesn't need a firmware, or

  * report the name(s) of firmware image(s) required,

  * with appropriate command line option, the attempt to download and install firmware is made,

  * with another option, a description how to get and install firmware is displayed.

The output should be usable by tools like YaST.

This can greatly improve user experience when installing wi-fi cards with YaST or similar tools.
