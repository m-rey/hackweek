{{tag>JudgeMe JudgeDesktop Done Desktop Evolution mail}}

===== Description =====
Add the functionality to Evolution to search for expressions like //"see attachment"//, //"see attached file"//, etc. and their localized variants (could be limited by language settings) at the time the users ignites the send command.

If those expressions were used in new parts of the email (not in the >-marked parts) and NO file is attached to the email, a dialog should pop up to ask the user whether the email should really be sent this way, aka it shows a attachment reminder, similar to empty subject or empty body reminders.

This should prevent the user from sending emails without attachment, although the main reason for the email was the attachment.

User defined expressions would be a benefit.

Could/should be implemented as a plugin.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
