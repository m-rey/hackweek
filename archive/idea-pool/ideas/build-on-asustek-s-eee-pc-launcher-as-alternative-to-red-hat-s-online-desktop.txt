===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
To date, activities to improve on the current desktop-metaphor (especially its usability) can roughly be categorized as follows:

  * Menus, however improved upon the original hierarchical approach (Kickoff in KDE, new GNOME-main-menu)
  * Docks (Macintosh, Avant, KDocker etc.)
  * Sidebars (Google Desktop, BigBoard from Red Hat's 'Online Desktop', Vista Sideobard or whatever it's called)

These attempts can be categorized by how much screen-estate they constantly take, versus how easily they are constantly accessible:


Sidebars---------->Menus  ----------->Docks

wasteful ---------------------------->compact


cluttered --------------------------->simple to use

always accessible------------------>not always accessible


While Menus represent a good middle ground, not much innovation happens there - naturally. Most OSes try to combine the best of both worlds by having a couple of 'favorite' applications easily accessible (quick-launch icons, Dock, gnome-main-menu favorites) and hiding the rest of them somewhere else (deep hierarchy-level, application-browser, applications-folder). Even seemingly very different concepts go in similar directions there; like having an 'application browser' in both openSUSE and Red Hat's coming 'online desktop'. As Linus Torvalds said "It turns out that "round" is simply a good form for a wheel to have".

The only real innovation that I have seen lately that figures similarly favorably on the axis above as the 'menu'-approach is the launcher that comes with ASUSTek's version of Xandros Linux for the 'Eee-PC'. Please see a demonstration that someone (not me) has put up here: http://honeypothack.com/eee/internet.htm

If this menu was enlarged for a high-resolution desktop, it could replace the current desktop analogy which has become pretty void of function - it usually contains only a few icons linking to HD-partitions and the Trash-folder.

If the ASUSTek's menu's tabs for application categories were constantly visible at the top of the screen we would sacrifice a little screen-estate - as little screen estate as the standard GNOME desktop sacrifices anyway, but we would get some real boost in accessibility IMHO.

ASUS have  published the source-code ([[http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePC/701/EeePC701_071012.zip]]), though only as part of a giant archive containing the whole Eee-PC OS.

As a compromise, the existing gnome-main-menu could be modified:

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
