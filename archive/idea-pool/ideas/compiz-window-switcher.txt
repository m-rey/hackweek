===== Description =====
We usually use the keyboard to switch between running application windows. Below is a mockup of a window switcher that keeps the keyboard controls, but adds the possibility to use the mouse as well. Due to the switcher comming up where the cursor is and the arrangement in a circle, there is no need to move the mouse too much or be precise.

This design could be implemented as a compiz plugin.

Additionally the switcher could keep track of the favorite apps in the SLAB and keep them arranged consistently (browser always on top, e-mail on the right, etc.) I would aid the user spatially.

===== People =====

Jakub Steiner originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

The same thing slowed down so you better see what's happening.
