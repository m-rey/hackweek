To allow themeability, the [[http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html|naming spec]] defines a few generic devices. It would make it a lot more personal and appealing if connected devices showed the actual specific device icons on the desktop and related applications (DAPs in Banshee, cameras in F-Spot during import). 

The generic fallback is necessary to allow theme authors to provide a visually consistent theme without the need to style all the individual specific device icons.

The specific icon name should be provided in the HAL FDI descriptor file.


===== People =====

Rodney Dawes and Jakub Steiner originated this idea.  Artists from the Tango project are already creating artwork. Rodney Dawes came up with a draft on the naming scheme. David Zeuthen and Matthias Clasen from Redhat were interested in the project as well.
