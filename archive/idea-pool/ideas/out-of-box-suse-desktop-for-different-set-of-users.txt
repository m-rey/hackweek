===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */

**Background**

 
There are few adonpation challanges for SLED/openSUSE for personal users. But the most prominent one is the availability of applications on Linux. Different set of users have different application requirements, and though there might exist an open source application, the end user might not be aware of it. Although SuSE's offering provides the richest set of applications, but this is not enough //as not everyone needs everything//. 

**Problem**

Users does not want the richest set of application, they want the most appropriate set of applications. SLED does very well in defining a set of applications for Corporate Desktop. But if SLED has to be deployed for different set of users (say school, hospital etc), they may not find the applications they need most. 

**Idea**

openSuSE/SLED can leverage the availability of large application set with openSuSE and with Open Source community in general. This can be done in two ways: 
  - SLED/openSuSE installation shall provide the options to select the TYPE OR PURPOSE OF DESKTOP to be installed. User can select their preference say "Desktop for HEALTHCARE" or "Desktop for HOME PC" etc. 
  - SLED/openSuSE may be released in different flavours say "NLD for HEATHCARE", "NLD for SCHOOLS" etc. 



//Depending on the flavour selected by user, Desktop  shall include the "most appropriate set of "APPLICATIONS", "THEME", "ICON SET", "LOOK and FEEL" etc.//
 

**Some Examples **

  * Desktop for Corporates and Governments: SLED in its current form suits best for this purpose. 
  * Desktop in Schools: They may require educational appilcatoins as well as some softwares to restrict students activities such as browsing. (e.g. www.ofset.org/freeduc-cd)
  * Home Desktop as general purpose or Multimedia Work Station: Home users may be interested in variety of Games and Multimedia applications (e.g. There are lots for live CD distribution specifically for Gaming and Multimedia) 
  * Desktop for Healthcare Industry: Hospitals would appreciate a desktop medical applications (e.g. worldvista.sourceforge.net) 
  * Desktop for Financial Appilcations 
  * Desktop for Bioinformatics applications: This is one of the fasted emerging feild (e.g. dnalinux.com)
