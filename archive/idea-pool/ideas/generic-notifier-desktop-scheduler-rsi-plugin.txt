===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
A generic user space Task Scheduler for the Enterprise Desktop with a generic, standard Notify/Alarm function that can be used by other applications on the desktop like e-mail, calendar etc. The goal is to have one standard notify system for applications on the desktop.

A plugin architecture should allow to subscribe and act on events from other applications, like e-mail or when a backup is finished.

plugins and functional ideas:
  * Notify on e-mail and calendar(s) (GroupWise, Evolution, Google calendar) events
  * RSI (Repetitive Strain Injuries) alarm functionality. Ergonomic software for the Enterprise Linux Desktop
  * ..
  * Initiate, schedule backups from the backups-made-easy idea (http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/backups-made-easy)
  * Launch desktop applications based on schedule 
  * FUN plugin, but good for office workers; scheduled alarm with random selector 'who will get the coffee'
