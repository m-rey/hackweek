====== Improve vformat plug-in for OpenSync ======
{{tag>Done Desktop Mobile openSUSE SLED}}

===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
The vformat plugin is one of the most important plugins for the OpenSync framework. You need it for synchronization with file-sync, syncml, irmc, kdepim, evolution, sunbird, etc.

With the help of OpenSync and the vformat plugin you can perform the following tasks:

Contacts:
  * convert from vcard21 to vard30
  * convert from vcard30 to vcard21

Events:
  * convert from vevent10 to vevent20
  * convert from vevent20 to vevent10

Todos:
  * convert from vtodo10 to vtodo20
  * convert from vtodo20 to vtodo10

In general you can convert every vcalendar 1.0 (vcal) and vcalendar 2.0 (ical) entry to its counterpart. First we convert from source-format to xmlformat-contact or xmlformat-event. After this is done we validate the whole xmlDoc against a xsd schema and convert it to target-format.

There are still some open tasks:
  * add converter for xmlformat-event to vcal/ical
  * review xsd schemas and correct them
  * fix memory corruptions
  * add unit tests
