====== proc buster ======

{{tag>Idea HelpWanted Community QA Kernel openSUSE SLES SLED SLERT SLEPOS SLETC}}

===== Description =====
the proc fs is currently not tested well enough, a lot of bugs related to race conditions are reported.
Andi Kleen suggested to loop over all processes in /proc, open()/close() the entries, read from /proc/*/mem/ and also access other non PID related /proc entries.


===== People =====

Olli Ries originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
