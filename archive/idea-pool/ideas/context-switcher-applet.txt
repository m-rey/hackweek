===== Description =====
Create an applet that lets users create new virtual desktops (aka workspaces, viewports etc.) when needed in order to organize their work more efficiently. Remove the different terms/concepts by introducing the concept of contexts.

Applet should be similar to the window selector applet in GNOME, but with functionality to create/handle contexts (which would be workspaces in regular setups and viewports in XGL setups).


**Current state**

The current GNOME Desktop in both SLED and openSUSE does not provide workspaces by default. IMHO this has two reasons:
  * Workspaces are not recognized in desktop effects enabled environments
  * The one panel setup doesn't provide enough space for a multi-workspace setup greater than 4 (at least on a 1024px wide display)

Currently we have different terms and concepts describing the very same thing: "virtual desktops", "workspaces" and "viewports" all provide some kind of "creating additional screen estate to keep your work organized".

Many people have used these concepts to organize their work into contexts, e.g.:
  * Workspace 1: windows/apps related to work-in-progress project A
  * Workspace 2: windows/apps related to research project B
  * Workspace 3: intersting yet unrelated browser windows (aka collateral browsing)
  * Workspace 4: communication apps, say Pidgin and Evolution

However this //process// is done totally //in the mind of the user//. A new user first has to learn what he/she can do with workspaces and why they are useful. Furthermore it's rather static, i.e. creating new workspaces for new contexts requires too many clicks.

**Introducing Contexts**

By introducing the concept of contexts we gain two main advantages:
  * Remove the different terms/concepts depending on the user's setup. It's always a working context you see.
  * For users new to multi-workspaces setups, it might be easier to grasp what they can do with the technology. Because we expose the technology as a work process.

One obvious disadvantage:
  * Other uses of workspaces are out of scope or rather the term might not fit other processes

**Implementation**

Applet should work like the window-selector applet but be aware of contexts. This means a minimum of needed panel space to do both window and context switching which is positive for single panel setups. Include a "Show Desktop" item in the menu and the applet could take the place of the "Show Desktop" applet currently by default on the panel in both openSUSE and SLED (IMHO, that would be exactly the place, where it makes most sense to be).

The technological concept behind (workspaces vs. viewports) should be hidden.

Joerg Kress originated this idea.  Joerg is currently doing UI research. Help always appreciated. The UX team might help.

Mockups coming soon...

Interesting code might be in libwnck, gnome-panel and the super-switcher project.


/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
