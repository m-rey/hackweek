====== Write a core dump collector ======

{{tag>Idea devtool bugs}}

===== Description =====

Recent kernels can run a program when a core dump happens (by
writing |programname into /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern) Write a suitable
script that extracts some information out of it using gdb (like backtrace/program name etc.)
Then write a gui tool that displays them.

Possibly it could be also submitted to a website.

Bonus points if it knows how to fetch debuginfo packages automatically to get
symbolic backtrace.

===== People =====

Andi Kleen originated this idea. No one is currently working on implementing the idea (it's up for grabs!).
