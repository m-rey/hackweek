===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
A systemwide operating universal and easy extensible help agent framework (with three layers) to give users a helpsystem not specific to a special app or desktop.

Frontends could be textbased (for usage on pure textconsole) or even as interactive avatar.
Backends to scan and analyze the system, for integrating additional system-"knowledge" could build a easily extensible framework to find "most common" errors in system.

A daemon running in background - looking for various suspicious or even dangerous situations - could inform the user of possible problems the system has. The other way round the user could query the framework - via the various frontends - if e.g. the harddisk is ok as it is sooo slow .. which will make the framework to look for backends to scan and analyze the disk, telling the user "don't know yet, but i can check for it via "foobar-test" and "foobar-benchmark" if it is working as appropriate.. do you want me to proceed (y/n)?" .. and so forth

The Frontends need to do the parsing themselves, trying to identify what the user asks for, comunicating with the framework with a defined API .. _but_ the framework could also help the frontends via special knowledge-backends that e.g. could hold common phrases for often arising problems.

The framework could eventually also include some sort of automated learning .. associating found system states with arising problematic symptoms.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
