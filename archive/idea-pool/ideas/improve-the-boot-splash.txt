====== Improve the boot splash ======

{{tag>Idea Kernel openSUSE SLED}}

===== Description =====
The current boot splash implementation is a bit uninformative. For example, if
the file system is being checked (ext3 is our default file system!), then it
looks for the average user as if the system just is crash, if he doesn't watch
the HDD LED (or has a noisy disk :-)).

This is related to "Write a user friendly frontend for fsck" (don't know how
to create links in that wiki).

===== People =====
Bernhard Walle originated this idea.  He's working during hack week on that
project.
