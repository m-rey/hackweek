{{tag>Idea}}

===== Description =====
It would be nice to have a interface between the NTS (Novell Standard Support) and the QA department, which automatical gathers the information about which problems occured the most.
Then it should generate a list which informs the QA department about what to give more/special focus.

===== People =====
Marco Michna originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
