====== RSS News feeds for SWAMP ======
{{tag>Done swamp InBuildService }}

===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */


Add configureable Newsfeeds (RSS, Atom) for Workflow/Tasks lists in SWAMP. 
For example "my tasks" newsfeed, "latest workflows" newsfeed...
All workflow lists in webswamp should have an XML button at the bottom that links to 
the corresponding newsfeed. 

The rss reader needs to support HTTP-auth to use the swamp feeds. 

This feed can be used by this (http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/dynamic-web-service-portal) idea. 

I also added Atom feed support to the Keeper.
