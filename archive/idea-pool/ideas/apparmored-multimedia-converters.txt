===== Description =====
It would be nice to have some sandbox for apps like ImageMagick, sox
etc. The problem is, that these apps need access to any file the user
gives on the command line, so it's almost impossible to create
meaningful policy. It should however be possible to do the following:

1) create a temporary directory in a known place, eg.
~/.ImageMagick_playground/

2) find out which input files are needed and copy / link them to the temp.
directory

3) replace paths to real input / output files with paths to the temporary
directory

4) switch to a restricted profile, see below

5) run the actual conversion code, than may potentially be buggy

6) switch back to normal profile

5) move resulting output files to the original destination

Now a profile would only need to allow access to the
~/.ImageMagick_playground directory. Step 1) could even be improved by
creating separate directories for input and output files, to that the
profile could deny write access to input files.

This could either be implemented by writing a small wrapper that does
steps 1) to 3) and executes the real app that is apparmored, or by
patching the app and doing change_hat in steps 4) and 6).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
