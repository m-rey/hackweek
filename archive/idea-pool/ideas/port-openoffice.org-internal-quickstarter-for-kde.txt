===== Description =====
OpenOffice.org includes the quickstarter for GNOME out of box. You can enable it in "Tools/Options.../OpenOffice.org/Memory/Enable systray quickstarter". It has two effects. It shows a small icon in the systray, so you can very easily open a new document. It keeps one OOo instance running on background, so any new OOo window is opened much faster even if you start it from the command line.

There exists the old standalone [[http://segfaultskde.berlios.de/index.php?content=oooqs|OOo quickstarter for KDE]] but it has bugs, it is an older code, hard to maintain, ...

One solution is to use the current GTK systray stuff in KDE as well. We would need to intgrate the OOo and GTK main loop together even in KDE. It does not look easy...

Second solution is to create the KDE specific systray icon, menu, ... By the other words, we needed to create libvclplug_kde680lx.so. Unfortunately, there is similar problem. We need to integrate the QT main loop into the OOo main loop.

The second solution looks more clean. In addition, the QT main loop would be nice also for the Open/Save file dialog, so is the way to go.

I was not expert in these areas. I have spent a lot of time with studying and various attempts. I have been able to get a basic functionality working. The latest patches are available at

[[http://svn.gnome.org/svn/ooo-build/trunk/patches/test/vcl-add-simle-qteventloop.diff]]
[[http://svn.gnome.org/svn/ooo-build/trunk/patches/test/sfx2-test-kde-systray-stuff.diff]]

(The timers and SocketNotifiers are not solved, but the sample systray stuff works and does not block OOo.)

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
