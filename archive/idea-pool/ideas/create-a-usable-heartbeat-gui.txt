====== Create a usable Heartbeat GUI ======

/* If this is your first time using the Idea Pool, please take a second to read the  comment at the end of this template, which explains how to use tags.  

Topic tags: Community, Security, QA, Kernel, Desktop, Virtualization, Web20, Mobile, Management, Network, UnixFeature, Server, LowPower, Performance, LAMP, Graphics, DevTool, Mono, IdeaPool
Product tags: openSUSE, SLES, SLED, SLERT, SLEPOS, SLETC
Status tags: Idea, InProgress, TryMe, InBuildService, Done, Shipped
Help tags: HelpWanted, HW-Hacker, HW-Tester, HW-Designer, HW-PM, HW-Docs, HW-Packaging

Separate tags with a space like this:
{{tag> blargle fizzbozz bimbledeedoo}}
*/

{{tag>Idea Management Server SLES}}

===== Description =====
The existing GUI supplied with Heartbeat is
  * buggy
  * user unfriendly
  * destroys any part of the configuration it doesn't understand
  * based on a fundamentally flawed design

The idea is to resurrect the GUI which abeekhof started earlier in the year which performs the visual equivalent of XSLT processing.

The GUI can be configured to use a specified class to render a given tag and gracefully fails back to XML text blocks for anything it doesn't understand.  The initial classes will be "form"-based, but only time and inclination prevent a more visual drag-n-drop set of classes.

Eventually it would be nice to have some step-by-step wizards for resource creation.

The GUI will leverage existing CLI tools supplied with heartbeat and provide the ability to preview the effect of configuration changes.

Andrew Beekhof originated this idea and will probably work on it during HackWeek.
