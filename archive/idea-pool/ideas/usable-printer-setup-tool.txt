===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */

Our current YaST printer setup module shows its age:
It was enhanced from what we had before CUPS
(lprold/apsfilter, LPRng/lpdfilter),
then when both CUPS and LPRng/lpdfilter were supported,
up to now when only CUPS is supported.
Currently the YaST printer setup tool somehow works o.k.
but its usability is not really good.

When I tested the KDE printer setup tool, the Gnome printer setup tool,
and the CUPS web frontend, all do somehow work o.k. but the usability
is also not really good.

I think that the common usability problem is that all printer setup tools
ask the user for a reasonable set of parameters to set up a print queue
but as far as I see it looks obscure for an unexperienced user
what there is really going on "behind the scenes".

I think what is missing in the current printer setup tools
from the usability point of view is to provide a thoroughly honest
and truthfully view to the user what there is really going on.

There are already some ideas about "YaST2 Printer UI enhancement", see
http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Printer

I don't have only "UI enhancement" in mind.

What I have in mind is a completely new design from scratch
which is focussed on usability.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
