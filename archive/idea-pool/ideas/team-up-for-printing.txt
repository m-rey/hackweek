===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */

"Printing does not work" Hubert once said. 

While many parts of our printing pipeline are quite solid nowadays (cups, kprinter, gimpprint), the interface between the individual components could be improved. I consider both generation of postscript pages and the processing of postscript pages as part of one printing pipeline. Currently applications focus on generating, 
and cups focusses on processing, with very limited interaction between these two parts.

The printer-dialog that a user sees should not be application specific, it should be considered part of the operating system, with application specific plugins on one end and cups specific plugins on the other. 

I suggest to implement a generic preview mechanism, that brings back an image of a printed page to the user from as late in cups as possible. I'd expect to see the effects of settings like multi-page printing, scaling, rotation in such a preview.

I also suggest to integrate all the available psutils into this printing pipeline as plugins.
e.g. the commandline tools pstops and poster are most useful, but badly need an interactive GUI.

Application specific plugins could e.g. define font sizes to a browser and cause HTML-page layouts to depend on such settings.

/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Juergen Weigert originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
