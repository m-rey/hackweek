===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
The test matrix for install tests is incredible large (>100 scenarios) - doing all of them manually is not feasible.

Leveraging our cool tool [[http://www.suse.com/~ug/autoyast_doc/index.html|AutoYaST]] and (on architectures where appropriate) virtualization technologies can help increasing the automation level dramatically. 

What we probably need:

1. a central repository hosting AutoYaST profiles including support for
  * different architectures, virtual machines
  * different partition layouts
  * network interfaces
  * ...

The repo definitely should make use of the full powers of AutoYaST's [[http://www.suse.com/~ug/autoyast_doc/rulesandclass.html|Rules & Classes]] concept.

2. integration for XEN / kvm / ... 

3. integration into the QA infrastructure
  * CTCS   - test frame work
  * HAMSTA - hardware scheduler
  * ...

(and finally, of course;)

  4. a set of checks to validate the installed system

Olli Ries originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

Martin Mrazik is playing with this idea.
