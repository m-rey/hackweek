====== Developer documentation wiki ======

{{tag>InProgress Community DevTool Documentation}}

===== Description =====

As it was already mentioned on research mailing list, there is a sore need for a comprehensive, hypertext, up-to-date system documentation for developers. Currently, some parts of the system API are not documented at all or very poorly (e.g. the ioctl() interface), some have very obsolete documentation (glibc).

The documentation should be a community, wiki-style project.

The project also involves some programming because no wiki engine known to me has all features needed for such a massive specialized knowledge base, so there is an option of tweaking an existing wiki engine, or writing a brand new. Currently I have followed the former, but the latter seems to be more and more appealing.
