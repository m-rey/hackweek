===== Description =====

You may think that a GTK designer ist still integrated and it would also make
no sense to integrate a second form designer, but it makes sense! 
A WinForms designer would give you the possibility to create nice UI in a very
short term. It would also be an assurance for interoperability, because
apps with a WinForms GUI don't need a GTK on Windows.
 

===== People =====

Andy Pischka originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
