===== Description =====
Many people begin to use Tomboy for jotting down quick notes.  Then they take their laptops to a meeting and take notes there.  When they're back in their offices, they start using their big desktop computers and also take notes there.

Then they run into a problem ...

They search for a note on one of their computers and can't find it.  It must be on the other computer.  So, essentially, they stop using Tomboy entirely or are just forced to use one computer for taking notes.

This Hack Week Project is primarily made to fix this problem.  Notes should be synchronized between all of your computers so you've always got them.  A user should be able to quickly and easy set this up.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Boyd Timothy, Sandy Armstrong, the Desktop team, and the Tomboy Community originated this idea.  Boyd Timothy and Sandy Armstrong implemented this during hack week.

We worked together with Calvin Gaisford to also provide note sharing (giving) in [[http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/easy-file-sharing|Giver]].

===== Where can I get it? =====

Warning: Please do not try this yet with your real Tomboy notes.  Use at your own risk (i.e., make a backup of ~/.tomboy first).

===== TODO =====

See http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/Synchronization for the latest developments.

===== Status: Thu Jun 28, 7:00 AM MDT=====
Basic synchronization appears to be working.  We're in debug mode now.  We've implemented synchronization so it synchronizes to a file system path for simple debugging.  The idea right now is to sync to a mounted FUSE file system.

We've had decent success synchronizing to a path mounted by wdfs (WebDav FS).  We gave GmailFS a shot yesterday without much luck.  Eventually, the idea will be to provide a drop-down list of choices in the "Synchronization Preferences" window where the user would choose which service they want to synchronize to and punch in a username, password, path (as needed) and we'd set up the path/mounts programmatically.

If you want to take a look at the code, we're working in the "tomboy-sync" branch ([[http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/tomboy/branches/tomboy-sync/]]).

**WARNING: If you are brave and try out the code right now, PLEASE do not try it with your real set of notes.  In other words, please first move ~/.tomboy to a new directory.  We'll give the "go-ahead" later when we feel it's "safe" to try on your real notes.**

===== Status: Fri Jun 29, 7:00 AM MDT=====

After almost 24 hours of straight hacking, we've got WebDAV, SSH, and local file system sync support via FUSE.  Now it's time to pretty-up a few things before we give a demo.

Mounting a WebDav location with FUSE (wdfs):

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
