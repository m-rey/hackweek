====== Seamless, scalable NFS fail-over on top of OCFS2 ======

{{tag>Idea Server Network UnixFeature SLES HelpWanted filesystem}}

===== Description =====

While Novell/SUSE has a powerful fail-over solution with Linux HA v2, the fail-over of NFS exports is not quite seamless due to lock handling, nor can several servers export the same NFS volume for scalability yet.

Tackling the missing code features in a Resource Agent for the cluster, writing a setup guide et ceters would be great.

===== People =====

Lars Marowsky-Br√©e originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
