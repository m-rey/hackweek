{{tag>Idea Desktop}}

===== Description =====
SLAB is a major hit in linux desktop. Its better to have a gnome panel like that. Ref the below link to view a sample. instead of following a max style menu or windows, linux can have its own visual like showed in this image. It might give a unique visual to SUSE if implemented
