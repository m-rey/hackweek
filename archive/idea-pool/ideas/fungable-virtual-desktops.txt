===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
Some companies have "laptop pools", where staff who are going on a business trip can check out a laptop for the duration of their trip, and check it back in when they return. Enterprises do this if travel for most staff is relatively rare, and they want to save money by having far less laptops than people.

There are a bunch of problems with this approach:
  * You don't get your personal desktop environment, you get some generic setup from IT.
  * To save you from someone else's infections and to protect their data, you have to re-install the box every time, which is time consuming.
  * Before you give the machine back, you have to find and save all the data on the machine you care about.

And this is all sufficiently annoying that many enterprises just don't do it.

Idea: [[http://www.answers.com/fungible&r=67|Fungible]] virtual desktops.
  * Each laptop has a minimal permanent install that is just a VM host, with suitable drivers for whatever hardware is in the machine
  * User desktops live in a big server as images
  * To check out a laptop, the user's desktop VM image is just copied to whatever laptop is handy

Security: You can encrypt the virtual volume, so the data is protected until it meets up with the user, who has the volume key on their personal USB memory stick. Note: need LUKS support for [[Make LUKS Support Memory Stick Storage of Disk Encryption Keys|external storage keys]]

An extension to this idea could be to support user desktops the same way. You would not want to transfer your 50GB VM image to your desktop every morning, but perhaps it could work if your VM image was NFS mounted from the big server, so it could be accessed on demand by a thin client.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Crispin Cowan originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
