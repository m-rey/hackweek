===== Description =====

There is no Administrator mode button in Systemsettings in KDE4 in kcm-plugins like "Login manager" or "Date & Time" which usually need administrator rights.

To implement this functionality using policykit would;
  - Provide the needed functionality and fix bug http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151669
  - Administrators and distributors would earn a common way/infrastructure to maintain such policies
  - After DBus we would earn another common freedesktop.org thing used and supported by the both major desktops
