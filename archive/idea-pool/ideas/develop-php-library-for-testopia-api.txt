===== Description =====

Testopia offers an access via XML-RPC API. Having a PHP library to access this API would offer websites (and commandline tools) read/write access to Testopia. The idea is to develop such a library.

Working with such a library would save QA team a lot of work and a lot of time.

It's - internal - available at http://w3.suse.de/~holgi/phpTestopialib.tgz

===== Information in telegraphic style =====

Testopia is an enhancement of Bugzilla. We use it to create TestPlans and track testing.
It can be controlled by a webinterface -> which works fine for people but bad for machines.
So Testopia got a XML-RPC interface.

My project was to develop a library which 'talks' to that Testopia interface. I decided to use PHP because it offers access from our webbased tools as well as from the commandline.

The library contains 72 functions and offers nearly all Testopia operations which are available via the webinterface. It is only limited by the Testopia API itself.

This library offers a bunch of new possibilities for our QA teams:
  * creation and modifing of TestPlans and TestRuns
  * creation and modifing of TestCases 
  * creation and modifing of Test Results
And all this by our scripts or tools.

To understand the benefit following example will help you.

Using the library with our QA tool HAMSTA:

With HAMSTA we can start testsuites on several testmachines via a webinterface. During the testsuites are running they execute a bunch of Testcases and store the results in result file.
This files will be colleted by the HAMSTA tool afterwards but the results have to be entered into Testopia by a person.

With my library HAMSTA can be enhanced to:
  * create a new TestPlan and assign relevant TestCases
  * create a TestRun for every hardware architecture
  * collect the results of all tests and enter them into Testopia
Creation of TestPlans and TestRuns will done automatically as well as entering all the results. 
So we save a lot of time in future and can – hopefully – take the time to develop more useful QA tools and libraries ...

And best thing of project:  it's finished and working fine!! :-)

Here is a small demo:
You can [[http://tidb.suse.de/testopia/demo.php|modify]] the status of a single TestCase of a certain TestRun from a non Testopia website and check result within [[https://bugzilla.novell.com/tr_show_run.cgi?current_tab=case_run&field-1-0-0=run_id&run_id=299&type-1-0-0=anyexact&value-1-0-0=299&pagesize=1&page=1|Testopia]]:
  * [[https://bugzilla.novell.com/tr_show_run.cgi?current_tab=case_run&field-1-0-0=run_id&run_id=299&type-1-0-0=anyexact&value-1-0-0=299&pagesize=1&page=1|Testopia view]]
  * [[http://tidb.suse.de/testopia/demo.php|Demo page]] (just available internal)
Of course this is just a simple demo. More complex operations are possible.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
