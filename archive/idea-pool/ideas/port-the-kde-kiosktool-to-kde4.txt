===== Description =====
The Kiosktool is a very important tool for larger deployments of KDE. Currently Kiosktool is not ported to KDE4, which will become a large handicap for KDE when choosing a desktop environment in these settings.

I work at Cendio AB in Sweden (http://www.cendio.com) with thin client systems. We deliver Linux desktops, mostly for school use, and I can't stress enough how important kiosktool has been in these installations.

===== People =====

Inge Wallin originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
