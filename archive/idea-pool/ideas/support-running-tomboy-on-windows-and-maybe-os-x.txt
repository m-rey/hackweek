====== Support running Tomboy on Windows (and maybe OS X) ======

{{tag> Idea InProgress Mono Windows Mac Desktop}}

===== Description =====

Finish work from old tomboy-portable branch to get Tomboy running nicely on Windows.  Initial investigation into gtk+ on OS X implies that things might not go as well there.

===== People =====

Sandy Armstrong originated this idea, and is currently working on implementing it.

===== Status =====

Running well on Windows XP and Vista, have already attracted two community contributors who have helped with bugs and Visual Studio issues.  Code will be merged into trunk after Tomboy branches for the 0.12.0 release (we're already in too many freezes to accept the code now).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.

HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
