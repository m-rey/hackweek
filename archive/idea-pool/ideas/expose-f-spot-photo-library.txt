===== Description =====

Many use F-spot to manage their photo library. Yet it's a very self-contained world. 

  * It would be nice if I could import images into the library using other tools. Similarly export.
  * I should be able to have Insert>Photo function in many applications that would allow me to search for photos using tags and provide a small thumbnail roll.
  * Media center application should have access to the photos.
  * The library should be optionally exposed on LAN using bonjour or whatever it's called now.
  * I should be able to transfer photos from my phone over Bluetooth/Obex.

Maybe there will be enough interest to standardize across management apps such as F-spot and Digikam so that apps would only worry about one API to query for photos.

===== People =====

Jakub Steiner originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
