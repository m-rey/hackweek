====== user controlled file backup gui ======

{{tag>InProgress rsnapshot gui backup}}
===== Description =====
Apple has a tool called "Timemachine" which makes it possible to restore data like pictures in a cool gui. The idea is to bring this tool to linux. I want to use rsnapshot for the backup and a konqueror toolbar to restore.

The user should be able to define a path where the data is backuped.
if an update exist the toolbar should enable the icons and allow a look in the backup.
