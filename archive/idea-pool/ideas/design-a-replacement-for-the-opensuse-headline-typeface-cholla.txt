{{tag> design font cholla replacement Community openSUSE FontForge OTF Graphics Idea TryMe}}

===== Description =====
Design a typeface and implement it into a computer font. The typeface is to have a similar geometric, techno feel as the current Cholla font used for openSUSE brandning, but freely licensed (OFL) so it can be used by the community.

===== People =====

Jakub Steiner originated this idea and has been working on getting the basic glyph coverage.
