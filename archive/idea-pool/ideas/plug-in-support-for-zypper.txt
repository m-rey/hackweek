====== Plug-in support for zypper ======

{{tag> InProgress SoftwareManagement HelpWanted}}

===== Description =====
In short, the idea is to enable developers to add custom commands or even influence behavior of zypper via plug-ins. More details follow.

PURPOSE & GOALS

  * to enable writing and packaging and installing new zypper features without touching the main zypper code or package
  * to enable adding zypper features that are specific to SUSE (or eventually other distro) flavor (e.g. webpin support is good for openSUSE, but not much so for SLE) and allow to enable them by default per-flavor.
  * a plug-in should (at the very least) add new commands that will also appear in the main 'zypper help' and tab-completion (better than remembering commands of a few separate tools)
  * plugin should have access to some common package management features used in zypper, like repository handling (access to the list of enabled repositories, loading repos, using a temporary repo), installation summary, common output (normal/warning/error messages, tables, progress), user prompt, etc. in order to reuse code.

TASKS

  * define what exactly should be a plug-in able to do (only add commands or even options for existing commands, or even more?)
  * define what exactly should be a plug-in able to do (only add commands or even options for existing commands, options for existing user prompts, or even more?)
  * identify commonly used zypper code that should be made available to plugins via the plugin API
  * create the plugin API
  * use the plugin API in zypper (this will probaly mean quite a bit of zypper code refactoring) and implment the plugin loading
  * implement an example plugin (e.g. webpin search)

DEVELOPMENT

The development should be done in a separate GIT branch and the master branch should be merged into it frequently to avoid later merging headache due to massive refactoring within the branch.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

  * Jano Kupec originated this idea and plans to work on it.
  * Anyone is welcome to join the effort, esp. if he or she has experience with making a C++ application plug-in enabled.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.

HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
