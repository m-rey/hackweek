===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
vym (view your mind) is a QT based application for mindmapping. It is used for collecting and sorting ideas, brainstorming, planning and learning.

It would be cool if several users e.g. in a telephone conference could see and maybe even modify a mindmap simultanously, kind of creating a network shared whiteboard.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Uwe Drechsel originated this idea and will be working on this. Hints how to best do the network communication are appreciated (vym is somewhat scriptable already).

===== Related Materials =====
/* Links, mockups, screen captures, files. */
* [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vym/|vym on sourceforge]] Source code is in the CVS there


===== Status =====
A vym instance can now connect via network as client to another vym running as server. The client duplicates all actions performed on the server. This even works cross platform: A client running in Mac OSX duplicates an openSUSE server: openSUSE rules ;-)

Not meant for production yet, e.g. the clients currently should not be allowed to modify their represntation of the map. At least not without sending the changes back to the server. The CVS version already has the network code, but server address is hardcoded right now. More convenient dialogs will follow in a couple of days.

The screenshot below shows two vym instances, the right one doubling the actions of the left one:

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
