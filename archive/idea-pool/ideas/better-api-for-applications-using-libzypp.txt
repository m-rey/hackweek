{{tag>Idea Libzypp YaST HelpWanted HW-Hacker}}

===== Description =====
Currently libzypp does not offer (or offers only very limited scope of) high-level functions 
for common package (patch, pattern) operations such as 'list all patterns','list packages
that belong to a pattern' 'list all objects fulfilling certain criteria' etc. 

If an application (such as UI library, zypper etc.) wants to use libzypp, it needs to implement
these functions by itself. As a result, the same functionality is (in better case) implemented by the code that is copy-pasted n times between n applications, or (in worse case) implemented inconsistently in n different ways.

The idea is to design API that would
1) make libzypp functionality easily accesible to the applications by offering simple functions 
returning data types convenient for the application
2) implement these functions once only (in libzypp or in a shared library over libzypp) so that
applications can simply call them and do not have to care about libzypp implementation details

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Katarina Machalkova originated this idea.  

Authors of applications using libzypp (HuHa - yast2-qt, Michael Meeks, Ricardo Cruz -yast2-gtk, Jano Kupec - zypper) might be interested as well

Katarina Machalkova would like to start with going through the code of y2-ncurses and y2-qt, to identify 
code consisting of libzypp functions only and evaluate which of this could be possibly moved to libzypp 
(a wrapper library over libzypp respectively). 

The next step will be to suggest suitable prototypes for these 'to-be-moved' functions so that they are
conveniently handled by UI library.

Help of libzypp hackers wanted!

Jano Kupec is planning to implement part of this idea (see comments).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
