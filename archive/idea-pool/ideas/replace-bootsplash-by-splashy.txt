===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
The old bootsplash patch for the kernel is now outdated and got superseded by splashy, a userspace solution for boot splash screens.
openSUSE already uses splashy via libsplashy for suspend2disk and resume splash screens but not for boot splash screens.
Therefore I suggest to replace the old bootsplash by splashy.

Johannes Engel originated this idea.  Holger Macht implemented the original splashy package for suspend and resume and might therefore be the ideal candidate for picking up this idea. ;)

===== Status =====
/* Status of the idea, things to be done... */
Some initial work is done which implies changes in /etc/rc.splash and /etc/rc.status. A proof-of-concept /etc/rc.splash with splashy integration can be found here: http://www.homac.de/files/rc.splashy

TODO
  * adaption to parallel booting (RUN_PARALLEL="yes") (adjust startpar from sysvinit package)
  * include splashy in initrd to get splash screen as early as possible
  * avoid breaking splash screen after reaching runlevel B
  * improve cooperation with Xorg (optional)
  * improve cooperation of splashy and kbd service (optional)
  * design a splash screen which allows printing log messages (optional)

/*Happy Hacking everyone!*/
