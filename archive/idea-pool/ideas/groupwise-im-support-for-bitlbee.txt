===== Description =====
BitlBee is a daemon that provides access to IM protocols via a IRC clients. It
supports different protocols including ICQ, Jabber, MSN, Yahoo.

Support for the Novell protocol would be nice. (And no discussion that gaim
and Kopete are much better.)

===== People =====
Bernhard Walle originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
