===== Description =====

The experience of logging into our desktop is somewhat flaky and flickery. It's a bit better with KDE, but still doesn't have a polished feel.

There should be minimal flicker and UI elements that do not respond. Windows suffers from this just as we do. I believe enlightenment did a nice curtain effect a long time ago where you would only be show a desktop when it was fully loaded and ready to go.

===== People =====

Jakub Steiner originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

===== Related Materials =====

Here's an older rendition how I'd imagine the login experience to be fluid and pleasant. But the dependence on 3D effects isn't necessary. Hiding the progressive loading below some fullscreen banner with progress bar or spinner is good enough.
