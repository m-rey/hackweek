====== provide a comprehensive summary of available test suites on opensuse.org ======

{{tag>Idea Community QA Desktop Performance DevTool openSUSE HelpWanted}}

===== Description =====
There are a lot of test tool matrixes out on the internet, some are outdated, some not applicable, some are moving quite fast.

My vision is that we provide the community some entry point to help with testing openSUSE.
Together with some yet to be published documentation around testing (provided by OPS-QA, this is wip) we might really get some more spin here.

The main task of this idea is to find out a feasible way to maintain the content - is a wiki sufficient for the needs or do we need some other backend.


===== People =====

Olli Ries originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

Contact Chris Hueller for more details on this topic.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
