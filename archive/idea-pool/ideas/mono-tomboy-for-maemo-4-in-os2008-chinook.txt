====== Mono + Tomboy for Maemo 4  in OS2008 (Chinook) ======

{{tag>Idea InProgress Mobile Mono DevTool HelpWanted HW-Hacker HW-Tester HW-Docs HW-Packaging}}

===== Description =====

Mono already works for Maemo 2 and 3 (OS2007 Bora) but not for Maemo 4 (OS2008 Chinook).  OS2008 is the current OS used in the Nokia N810 and is also compatible with the N800.

The goal of this project will be to bring mono support to the Maemo 4 platform.  Tomboy (a mono note application) will be used to test mono feature support.

Maemo apps built against OS2007 will not run out of the box on OS2008. This link outlines the differences between the SDKs: http://maemo.org/development/sdks/api_changes_between_maemo_3_2_and_maemo_4_0.html This is important because it means the mono wrappers will need to be reworked.

===== Scratchbox Howto =====

Maemo has resources for the scratchbox installer here: http://maemo.org/development/sdks/maemo_4_0_chinook_sdk.html

The actual howto is located at the Mono project site: http://www.mono-project.com/Maemo This page contains the steps //(in the future)// required to build Mono under scratchbox with repeatable results.
 
Note: http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:ARM also has some information.
