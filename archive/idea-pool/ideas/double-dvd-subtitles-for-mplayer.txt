===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
when we want to learn a foreign language, below things may be happening:

a good thing is watching DVDs is an enjoying way

a bad  thing is we can't catch up the lines some times

a good thins is DVDs have the foreign subtitle

a bad  thing is there are lots words that we never met before

a good thing is DVDs have our mother language subtitle too

a bad  thing is mplayer can't display the both subtitles at the same time

a good thing is hack week lets pacino make mplayer do it

a bad  thing is pacino may be one step away from success

a good thing is pacino is given the ... failure ITO days, watching lots of DVDs for a week.
