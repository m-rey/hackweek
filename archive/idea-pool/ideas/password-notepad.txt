{{tag>Idea Desktop security}}

===== Description =====

I use a different password for each site that I connect to, the idea being that I do not want a compromised password in one site to give access to someone to data that I might have in another site.

I keep this in a file ~/docs/passwords.pgp and I use a small shell script file that decodes the passwords to let me see them or edit them, and when I save those changes it encrypts the file again (to prevent accidentally spilling all my passwords).

In Gnome there are things like the Gnome Key Chain that work with desktop applications, but these passwords are for gnome applications, there is no easy-to-use interface for storing other kinds of info (like my social security number, my university id, my MSDN subscription login) 

Although Mozilla can remember many of those sometimes I need a bit more data than just the login and passwords or I might want to keep track of various user names, or I might not trust Mozilla enough to keep my passwords (as it often does).

The tool would:
  * provide access to an encrypted file on the disk
    * Mono has all the crypto libraries needed for this
  * protect it with a password.
  * Allow me to search, add, remove entries from this table

This could be accomplished by providing a GUI for storing the web site information and storing the data on Gnome KeyRing

Other pluses would be:
  * Store the file remotely on a public server
  * Public server being amazon storage
  * public server being Google gmail account
  * Public server being a GData accessible location. 

===== People =====
/* People working on this, interested people, knowledgeable people */
Miguel de Icaza originated this idea.

If this is implemented with Mono you can:
  * Use Gnome-KeyRing-Sharp API to store the data 
  * Use GData from Google to store the data in remote sites.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
