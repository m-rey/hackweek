===== Description =====
Currently SaX2 only supports a few TabletPCs by default. These are at the moment:
  * ACER TravelMate C30x series (SERIAL)
  * Fujitsu Lifebook T series (SERIAL)
  * Fujitsu Lifebook P series (SERIAL, touchscreen)
  * Gateway M280E (Finepoint FPI2004) 
  * HP Compaq TC1000 (FPI2002)
  * HP Compaq TC4200 (SERIAL)
  * IBM X41 TABLET PC (SERIAL)
  * Lenovo X61 TABLET PC (SERIAL)
  * Motion M1200 (SERIAL)
  * Motion M1400 (SERIAL)
  * Wacom ISDV4 TABLET PC (SERIAL) (with touch support)
  * Wacom ISDV4 TABLET PC (USB)

You can e.g. run Wacom based often with the generic "Wacom ISDV4" entries, but they don't work in every case. SaX2 should support more TabletPCs with useful default settings.

An other problem is that there no good support for the Touch devices of TabletPCs with a Wacom USB Tablet. The source of the problem is that there is no persistent device name (or link) for these devices under /dev/input/.

__What is to do?__
   - Support Touch devices of Wacom USB TabletPCs:
     * fix udev to generate persistent device links for these devices
     * extend the existing generic 'Wacom ISDV4 TABLET PC (USB)' SaX2 entry with a default config for touch
   - Support more TabletPc which uses only Touchscreen or non-Wacom Tablets:
     * fix SaX2 Touchscreen port handling (allow other /dev/input/ paths)
     * check, install and may update udev rules for existing touchscreen drivers
     * collect existing touchscreen entries for TabletPCs under 'TABLET PCs'
   - Add more TabletPCs to SaX2:
     * get in contact with TabletPC users or search for settings in the internet
     * add new machines to SaX2 (also such which only uses Touchscreens)
     * may extend HAL to detect machines as TabletPCs (if needed)
   - submit the patches for SaX2 and udev upstream
   - may update [[http://en.opensuse.org/TabletPCs|openSUSE TabletPC wiki page]]

__What can you do?__

Report currently not supported machines to [[http://en.opensuse.org/User:Dkukawka|Danny Kukawka]] with everything you needed to change in you xorg.conf. If you needed to calibrate your tablet (e.g. via wacomcpl), send also the calibration data/information. Also the output of lshal would help.

__Status:__
   * patched udev to add persistent by-id links (submitted upstream)
   * install udev rules of evtouch, added one more machine to the rules
   * extended SaX2 cdb with new machines and updated generic entry (get upstream as soon udev patch is integrated upstream)
   * move touchscreen based TabletPCs to a common 'TABLET PCs' entry of the SaX2 'Touchscreen' section
   * fixed SaX2 to handle ports/device path of touchscreen devices correctly (see this [[http://dkukawka.blogspot.com/2008/08/tabletpcs-new-machines-and-fixes-for.html|post]])
   * updated udev and SaX2 packages available in [[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dkukawka/|openSUSE Build Service]]
   * now SaX2 supports also these machines:
    * Clevo TN120R (a.k.a Nexoc Osiris S621) 
    * Gateway C-120X and E-155C (USB)
    * Gateway C-140X and E-295C (Serial)
    * Gateway C210X (Serial fpit)
    * HP Compaq 2710p/2730p
    * HP Pavilion tx2000 series (USB)
    * HP Pavilion tx2100 series (USB)
    * HP Pavilion tx2500 series (USB)
    * HP TC4400 (Serial)
    * LG LT20 Tablet PC (Serial)
    * LG C1 (Serial, fujitouch)
    * Panasonic Toughbook CF-18 (Serial)
    * Samsung Q1-Ultra (evtouch)
    * Toshiba Portégé M series Tablet PC (Serial)
    * Toshiba Satellite R15/R20 (Serial)
    * Toshiba Tecra M series Tablet PC (Serial)

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
