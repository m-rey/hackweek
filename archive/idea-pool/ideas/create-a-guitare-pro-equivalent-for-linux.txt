===== Description =====
The idea is to create a Tool like Guitare Pro (http://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php) for the linux world. This tool should it make possible to show tabs or notes in a grafic interface. This interface should allow to change this and write it down in some file formats like a simple text file. Tools like this should help learning an instrument like guitar or keyboard.

There are already implementations of this idea. Tuxguitar is one of them written in Java. But i like a more comfortable C++ Programm.

===== People =====
Michael Skibbe originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
