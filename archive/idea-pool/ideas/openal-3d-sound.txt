====== enhance OpenAL Surround Sound ======

{{tag>Desktop SLED openSUSE sound InProgress}}

===== Description =====
The OpenAL reference implementation for Linux seriously lacks features that are standard on other operating systems:

  * It only renders four channel surround sound (4.0) whereas modern sound cards and systems typically support 5.1 or 7.1
  * one cannot configure/tune the speaker placement
  * it has no hardware acceleration. There used to be an enhanced OpenAL for emu10k1 cards (sb live) which consumed less cpu than the OpenAL reference implementation
