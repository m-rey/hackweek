===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
NetworkManager is a great tool for setup network connection, especially for the wireless. Now is possible to use it only from KDE/GNOME session using KNetworkmanager/NetworkManager-gnome plugins.
I would like to have something in ncurses/CLI usable without DE neither X.

For reasons of feasibility I use Python with D-Bus to communicate with NetworkManager. 

==== Code Example ====

# create object for using system bus from d-bus
>>>import dbus
>>>bus = dbus.SystemBus()</pre>
# create network manager object instance
>>> nm = bus.get_object('org.freedesktop.NetworkManager', '/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager')
# call state() method of networkmanager to show status
>>> nm.state()
dbus.UInt32(3L)

# show active connections (created by KNetworkManager/NetworkManager-gnome)
>>> nm.GetActiveConnections()
 dbus.Array([dbus.Struct( (dbus.String(u'org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings'),dbus.ObjectPath('/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/Connection/1'),dbus.ObjectPath('/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/Connection/1'),dbus.Array([dbus.ObjectPath('/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/net_08_00_27_6b_5a_9a')],signature=dbus.Signature('o'))), signature=None)],
signature=dbus.Signature('(sooao)'))

# What we can see there? In this case connection created by KNetworkManager

# There are object identifiers for :

#           Connection ('/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/Connection/1')

#           Device ('/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/net_08_00_27_6b_5a_9a')

# Then we can create proxy objects for them

>>> net0 = bus.get_object('org.freedesktop.NetworkManager', '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/net_08_00_27_6b_5a_9a')

>>> con1 = bus.get_object('org.freedesktop.NetworkManager', '/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/Connection/1')

# we can research properties of any object

>>> net0_props = dbus.Interface(net0, 'org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties')
>>> net0_props.Get('org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device', 'DeviceType')

# we can disconnect net0 device and connect it again

>>> net0.Disconnect()
>>> nm.ActivateDevice(net0, 'org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings', con1, con1)

==== TODO ====
From the example above you can see I used already existed connection. If we want remove KNetworkManager/NetworkManager-gnome applet, we should re-implement functionality from nm-plugin to create/store Connection with UserSettings data and functionality to propagate it to NetworkManager. Then we can use NetworkManager from runlevel 3!

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
