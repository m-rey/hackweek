====== Floor Tool for Prague Office ======

{{tag>Done Desktop Presence Floor Internal}}

===== Description =====
The Prague office has grown quite a bit and we lose track of who is who where when. In Nuernberg there is /suse/bin/floor, even including the previous Prague office.

We need to either update /suse/bin/floor or write a local tool. (BTW lately the net connection is so fast that it is viable to run /suse/bin/floor over plain ssh+X.)

It would be cool if it could automatically detect people's presence from IRC, GWIM, and Jabber.
