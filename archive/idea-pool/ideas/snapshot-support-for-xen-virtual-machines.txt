===== Description =====
Implement DMTF SVPC snapshot modeling for Xen.  SVPC modeling has notion of ‘Full Snapshot’ and ‘Disk Snapshot’. Full snapshot includes a snapshot of vm memory image as well.  I would like to implement full and disk snapshot support.  Will start with LVM vbds since LVM contains snapshot support.
