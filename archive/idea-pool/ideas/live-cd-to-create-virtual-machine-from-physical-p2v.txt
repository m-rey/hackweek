===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
Create a SUSE-based Live CD that helps create a virtual machine from the physical machine.

Sample use case:

Customer has existing server, with installed apps and data.  Customer prefers to not have to re-install to virtualize the server.  Customer puts p2v CD in server and reboots.  YaST starts (similar experience as starting an install).  YaST probes hardware (discovers # of NICs, # of drives, amount of memory, architecture, etc.)  YaST prompts user for destination (NFS, SMB/CIFS, iSCSI, or perhaps local hot-plugged disk) of where to create the VM's disk image(s).  The local disk(s) are copied to the destination and YaST also writes out a VM configuration which matches the physical machine.

Some advantages this has over other other manual tools (ghost or "dd"):
  * VM configuration created automatically to match physical machine
  * Can re-configure OS automatically.  Example:  The virtual NICs' MACs will not match the physical NICs' MACs; this could be fixed automatically (for some OSs)
  * Could paravirtualize automatically (for some OSs)
  * Can convert/compress the disk format during copying
  * Don't have to physically move hard drive to new server
  * Independent of what OS customer is running

YaST could use the existing vm-install code to write out the VM configuration.

Probably would only do file-backed disk images to avoid filesystem-resizing issues (for now).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
