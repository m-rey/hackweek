===== Description =====

<html><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1383078292602807933&hl=en" flashvars=""></embed></html>

I have an iPod, but it doesn't hold all of my music.  More frequently than I'd like, I really need to listen to a song which isn't on the iPod, but which is on my much larger music library at home.  There's no way for me to easily get to it, without (a) finding out my IP address, (b) ssh'ing into the gateway, (c) finding the file on the filesystem on my home machine, (d) scp'ing the file to the gateway or through the firewall and (e) playing it singly with either RealPlayer or importing it into a local Banshee library.  Yuck.

The idea is to build a web UI for the Banshee library.  At first, simply navigating your music and downloading a single MP3 file would work.

As the project progresses:

  * It would be very nice if this was AJAXy and refined my list of music as I clicked through a browse interface.
  * We'll need to password protect the music, so that not just anyone can download music.
  * Downloading MP3 files individually sucks; we might need to use Flash or Silverlight here to play songs one by one like Banshee's library does now.
  * It might be nice to tie this into a [[http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/suse-linux-home-server|"Home Server" product]]; ideally the server would use DAAP to discover existing music shares on the network and make them available.

===== Architecture =====
The current plan is to program the front end in Javascript with the [[http://jquery.com|JQuery]] library.  Requests to the backend will be simple REST requests, possibly using JSON as the serialization mechanism.  Using HTTPS and HTTP Basic auth will probably be fine for the authentication.  On the backend, we could use ASP.NET and talk with an existing running Banshee service using D-Bus.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Joe Shaw originated this idea, and is presently learning Javascript on the fly by writing the front end.  He would be happy if someone with HTML and CSS experience made a basic mockup which looked pretty and hackers interested in working on the backend -- either the server side of things or a bridge between Banshee and the server.

Jakub Steiner has been working on making the site beautiful with his icon, HTML and CSS skills.  He also hasn't been afraid to tread into Joe's terrible Javascript as necessary either.

===== Live Server =====
You can see the code running in action here: http://joeshaw.org/banshee-web

Although the data right now is served from static JSON files, not an actual backend database.  I sure hope you like mysong.mp3!

===== Code =====
We decided to use git for this project also as a learning experience.  Joe's git repo is here:

  git://people.freedesktop.org/~joe/banshee-web.git

and Jakub's is here:

  git://people.freedesktop.org/~jimmac/banshee-web.git

You can pull down the code using ''git clone //uri//'' and keep it up to date with ''git pull''.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
