====== Creating a Condensed Monospaced Font ======
{{tag>Artwork Font InProgress HW-Designer}}

===== Description =====
We see it every day, we normally donâ€™t think about it, but it is nevertheless important: Fonts. Obviously we need fonts to communicate with each other, especially in digital media.

Today, we have very promising open source fonts: DejaVu, Gentium, LinuxLibertine, to name a few. Without these, our world of characters would be very small and limited.

However, the monospaced typefaces are a bit broad sometimes. If you have to document a configuration file with long lines, possibly the text does not fit into the margins of your text block. For this reason, we need a fixed-width (or monospaced) typeface in a condensed variant.

===== What's missing =====
Font design is very tough. As such, the font misses some important parts:

  * Some proportions have to be corrected
  * Hinting needs to be improved
  * Digits
  * More characters
  * Bold, italic, and bold+italic versions of the font
  * And probably much, much more
