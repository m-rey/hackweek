====== Integrate LTSP with openSUSE ======

{{tag>Idea Community Desktop Network Server IdeaPool openSUSE SLED Idea InBuildService HelpWanted}}

===== Description =====

Quoting ltsp.org: "The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux servers. LTSP is a flexible, cost effective solution that is empowering schools, businesses, and organizations all over the world to easily install and deploy desktop workstations. A growing number of Linux distributions include LTSP out-of-the-box."

openSUSE should also support LTSP out-of-the-box!


===== People =====

Christoph Thiel originated this idea.  There are a couple of community folks pushing for this already.
