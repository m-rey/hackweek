====== Limited user support for RPM ======

{{tag>Idea RPM Desktop}}

===== Description =====

At present the only persons who can make use of the package management on a system are those with administrative privileges. If a user wants to install and run an application as themself they will lose the benefits of package management such as dependency checking & easy installation and removal. 

Windows provides the facility to install MSIs either systemwide requiring administrative privileges or as the user installing.

RPM provides facility to use an alternative RPM database (a user's own) or simply extract the packages in a different location. Neither of these methods work very well.

It would be nice if a user could install software & any dependencies as themself in their /home using the system package management. The package manager could then inform the administrator upgrading system software when it is likely to break individual user's own installations as well.

Benjamin Weber originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
