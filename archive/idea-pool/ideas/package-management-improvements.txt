===== Description =====
There are also issues with the default package management tool so people have been looking for alternative tools. Fortunately there are a lot of package management tools compatible with openSUSE distribution that people can use. yum, smart, rcd to name a few. The common part of all these tools is that they have to download and parse the "open-package" (also known as yum metadata) XML and consume that data. There are two items I'd like to fix there:

1. All these programs update the metadata cache serially.
For each repository, download the compressed metadata file, write it on disk, read it back to check the checksums, read it again for uncompressing and parsing. This can all happen in parallel: Start the download of all repositories at once and set up the streams for downloaded data. The data can be handled as it's downloading (since it's the slowest part) and once the metadata is downloaded, the whole process should be done.

2. Once the data is parsed, all these tools load it all into memory.
This step is mostly done because dependency resolution code does a lot of lookups into the package cache and the easiest way to make that fast is to read it all into memory. That wasn't a big deal a couple of years ago (when these tools were designed) when distros where smaller and there wasn't a whole lot of 3rd party repositories. These days though, it's easy to have 30K packages available and all that metadata takes up a lot of memory. So the suggestion here is to provide a unified package storage API layer that is able to serve packages and dependencies fast without reading them all into memory. It could be integrated with beagle (or maybe even implemented with beagle).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
