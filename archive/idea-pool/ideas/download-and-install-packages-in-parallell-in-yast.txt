====== Download and Install Packages in Parallel in YaST ======

{{tag>Idea openSUSE SLES SLED HelpWanted Performance YaST}}

===== Description =====
We know it is hard to speed up package installation in YaST. But one of the areas
where we can definitely gain speed is to do things in parallel - especially the packages could be downloaded, delta-rpms applied etc in parallel with rpm running to install another package, so the installed does not need to wait for a package to be ready to feed rpm.

===== People =====

Stanislav Visnovsky originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
