# Historical Hack Week Data

This directory contains archived data about project from past hack weeks.

The fate.xml is an export of the public information stored in FATE, which
we used for a few hack weeks.

The idea-pool directory contains raw data from the DokuWiki, we used for
the first couple of hack weeks.

The githubwiki.json contains the data from the GitHub Wiki we used for
Hack Week 9 in JSON format. It's generated by the script projects2json from
the Wiki checkout.

The JSON data can directly be imported into the Hack Week web site. You can
for example use curl to post it to your instance of the app:

    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @data.json localhost:3000/api/import
